# Updates and Support

{% hint style="success" %}
To find out which Minecraft versions are currently supported, simply check the supported versions of the latest SlimeRanks version on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/slimeranks/versions).
{% endhint %}

## üõ†Ô∏è Update Strategy

**SlimeRanks** always aims to stay up to date and support the latest Minecraft versions as quickly as possible.

### How does it work?

When a new Minecraft version is released, we check if SlimeRanks still works with it. There are two possible outcomes:

1. **It works just fine:**\
   ‚Üí We simply add official support for the new version. No Plugin-Update needed.
2. **It breaks:**\
   ‚Üí We bump the **minimum supported Minecraft version** to restore compatibility. This means we **drop support for older Minecraft versions** at the same time.

### What happens to dropped versions?

Once support for a Minecraft version is dropped:

* ‚ùå No new features
* ‚ùå No bug fixes
* ‚ùå No security updates
* ‚ùå No support at all

In short: That version is no longer maintained.

### Why do we sometimes raise the base version _even_ if it still works?

Sometimes we drop support for older versions even if nothing is broken. Reasons for that might be:

* The version isn‚Äôt being used much anymore
* A newer Minecraft version includes a useful API feature we want to implement

### Can you still use older SlimeRanks versions?

Absolutely! Older versions of SlimeRanks will always remain available and can still be used ‚Äì even on newer Minecraft versions (though it‚Äôs not guaranteed to work).

Just keep in mind:\
**No updates. No bug fixes. No support. Use at your own risk.**
