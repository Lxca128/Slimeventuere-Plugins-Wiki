## ‚öôÔ∏èHow to configure SlimeRanks

I've tried to make the usage and configuration of SlimeRanks as easy and as powerful as possible. So there are two primary methods to configure SlimeRanks ranks after your needs.

The first and easiest method is to use the in-game GUI to create and manage ranks.\
If you like using a GUI to configure plugins, I recommend reading the following article.

{% content-ref url="configure-slimeranks-gui.md" %}
[configure-slimeranks-gui.md](configure-slimeranks-gui.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

If you prefer the manual configuration, I suggest you read the following article to configure ranks via the configuration file.

{% content-ref url="configure-slimeranks-config/ranks.yml.md" %}
[ranks.yml.md](configure-slimeranks-config/ranks.yml.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
